 In this project , I shall employ 3 primary machine learning algorithms in this project. Decision Tree, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boost (xg boost). I will apply the supervised algorithm decision tree for categorization. To determine our test score for our project, I will use the decision tree regressor. The random forest regressor is a different machine learning algorithm that may be found in this project. The Gradient boost-XG boost technique, in my opinion, is the most fascinating machine learning approach in my project. I want to employ this algorithm, because of its strong prediction abilities, it is quite accurate. XG boost is incredibly fast because it uses both a linear model and the tree learning algorithm.
